# Data-Image-Processing-Using-ML-Traning-Data
Data image processing using machine learning (ML) involves applying algorithms and models to extract meaningful information from images. This process typically includes several stages such as image pre-processing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Training data plays a crucial role in developing and refining these ML models.
